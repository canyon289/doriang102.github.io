	<h1>Hi there, </h1>My name is Dorian Goldman and this is my blog where I'll write about Data Science, Math, Music and other related topics.<br><br>
	
	I work as a <a href="https://www.condenast.com">Data Scientest at Conde Nast</a>, and as an adjunct professor of mathematics
	at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University </a>, where I teach the course <a href="https://github.com/Columbia-Intro-Data-Science/APMAE4990-">Introduction to Data Science in Industry </a>.
	
	
	Previously I was a Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a>, and before this, was a Herchel Smith Research Fellow at  <a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~dg443/">The University of Cambridge</a>, where I worked on problems
	related to energy driven pattern formation in mathematical physics.
