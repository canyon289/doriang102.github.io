# Knowing your distributions (Under Construction)

In this post we will dig deeper into the types of distributions that one encounters in practice. It takes a considerable amount of 
time and experience to understand and appreciate which distribution is most appropriate for the problem you're trying to solve.
While this list is by no means exhaustive, it is the list of distributions which I've personally encountered a need for:

1) Bernoulli
2) Binomial
3) Beta
4) Normal
5) Poisson
6) General Exponential
