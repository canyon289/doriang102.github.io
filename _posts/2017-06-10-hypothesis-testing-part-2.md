In this follow up, we look more carefully at the sample size necessary to make statistically valid
inferences from observations. 

Recall the Berry-Esseen theorem which, under certain assumptions, gives a rate of convergence to a normal distribution. In particular, if we have

$$ \mathbb{E}(|X_1|^3) := \rho < +\infty $$

then it follows that

$$\left|F_{n}(x)-\Phi (x)\right| \leq \frac{C\rho}{\sigma^3 \sqrt{n}},$$
