## Chi Squared

This derivation is often glossed over in many discussions of statistical significance of categorical variables. I suspect this has to do with a disconnect between the scientists who use these methods and the mathematicians who derived them. Let's start with 

$$Z = \sum_{i=1}^k X_i^2.$$
